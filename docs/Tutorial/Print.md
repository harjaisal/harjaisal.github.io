# **Printing with Python**

### What is Print?

Print is a *function* which allows you to see text, numbers, or other forms of data.

### What is a function?

A function is a piece of code that stores more code in itself. It allows you to perform tasks without having to write large amounts of code.

### How do you use functions in Python?

In Python, you call a function by typing its name followed by two parentheses. These parentheses can contain *parameter(s)*, which is data that the function can use to perform an action.\
For example, to call a function named print with the parameter "hello", we would type:\
`print("hello")`\
The word hello has to be in quotations so the computer understands it is a word as opposed to data. If we just wanted to print a number, like 2, for example, we would just have to use:\
`print(2)`

### What can we do with print?

Print allows us to visualize data, which is useful in a broad variety of applications. For example, we can view the value of hidden *variables*, which is a way to store data (we will talk about variables more in a later section), print the results of a calculation, or even just print out our names.\
Let's print out our names to practice. Since our names are words, we will have to give print the parameter with our names in quotations. We will put this parameter in parentheses and put print before the first paranthesis.\
For example, if your name was Armadillo, you would type:\
`print("Armadillo")`\
Run your code by following the directions in [How to Install and Use Python]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Tutorial/How%20to%20Install%20Python.html)\
View the result. It should look like this (if your name was Armadillo):\
`Armadillo`
