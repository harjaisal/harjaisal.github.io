### CodeBakersfield is working to improve access to coding education for students in Kern County.

This site serves as the virtual onboarding before you attend your first CodeBakersfield session. Here, you can access the Questions of the Week (QOTWs) and a tutorial for a brief introduction to Python. Attend the weekly Zoom sessions for live instruction and more detailed walkthroughs!
