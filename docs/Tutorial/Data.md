# **An Introduction to Data**

### What is Data?

Data is numbers, words, letters, sentences or anything else that we store information in while programming.

### How do we use data in Python?

Data is passed into *functions*, which are pieces of code which perform actions, like print. We can store data in variables and use those instead of directly inputting data.

```
# Using data directly in a function.
print("this is data")
print(1)

# Storing data in a variable.
data = "this is data"
otherData = 1

# Using data from a variable in a function.
print(data)
print(otherData)
```

### What are some types of data?

Here are some common types of data and their uses:
- Integers: Negative and Positive Whole Numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
- Strings: Words and Sentences (Hello, an, Strawberry, ...)
- Characters (Chars): Single Letters or Symbols (A, a, B, $, %, ...)
- Floats: Numbers with Decimals (1.21423, 3.1415, 1.00, ...)

### Where is data used?

Data is used everywhere in programming. Here are some examples:\
- Storing locations in video games.
- Storing weights (values that allows machine learning to happen) for neural networks.
- Storing and showing images.
- Even letting you see this information!
